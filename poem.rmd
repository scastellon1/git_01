In twilight’s gentle, fading light,    
The world is bathed in shades of night,    
Soft whispers drift on evening’s breath,    
As day gives way to dreams of rest.     

The stars emerge with silver gleam,    
Casting sparkles on the stream,    
While moonbeams dance on leaves so green,    
In a world both calm and serene.    

Time moves slow in this quiet hour,   
As nature surrenders to its power,    
And in the stillness, hearts can find   
A peace that soothes the restless mind.
